**Patient Wait List Dashboard - Power BI**

**Project Overview**

This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze and manage the patient wait list in a hospital, covering both inpatient and outpatient scenarios. The dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights into wait times, patient flow, and resource utilization, enabling hospital administrators and healthcare providers to optimize patient care and improve operational efficiency.

**Project Goals**

1. Track the current status of the patient waiting list.
1. Analyse the historical monthly trend of waiting lists in the Inpatient & Outpatient categories.
1. Detailed speciality levels & age profile analysis.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Wait Time Analysis:** Monitor and analyze wait times for both inpatient and outpatient services.
1. **Resource Allocation:** Assess the availability and utilization of hospital resources, including beds, medical staff, and facilities.
1. **Patient Flow Management:** Track and optimize the movement of patients through different stages of care, from admission to discharge.
1. **Bottleneck Identification:** Identify bottlenecks in the patient care process that may lead to increased wait times or reduced service quality.
1. **Predictive Insights:** Use historical data to predict future wait times and resource needs, allowing for proactive management.

**Data Scope** 

The data that we are having is from 2018 – 2021.

**Data Source**

The dataset includes detailed records from the hospital’s patient management system, containing information such as:

- **Patient ID:** Unique identifier for each patient
- **Admission Details:** Date and time of admission for both inpatient and outpatient services
- **Service Type:** Type of service requested (e.g., consultation, surgery, diagnostics)
- **Wait Time:** Recorded time between patient check-in and the start of medical services
- **Resource Allocation:** Information on bed occupancy, staff assignments, and facility usage
- **Discharge Details:** Date and time of discharge for inpatient services
- **Patient Demographics:** Age, gender, and other relevant demographic information

**Key Features**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and formatting data for accurate analysis
- **Dashboard Features:**
  - **Wait Time Tracking:** Real-time and historical analysis of patient wait times for various services
  - **Resource Utilization:** Visualization of resource allocation and usage across different departments and services
  - **Patient Flow Visualization:** Mapping of patient journeys through different stages of care, identifying potential delays or inefficiencies
  - **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identification of key areas where patient flow is hindered, allowing for targeted interventions
  - **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasting future patient wait times and resource needs based on historical trends
- **Interactive Visualizations:**
  - **Dynamic Filters and Slicers:** Allow users to drill down into specific departments, service types, or periods
  - **Customizable Dashboards:** Tailor views and metrics to meet the specific needs of different hospital stakeholders
  - **Charts and Graphs:** Includes bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps for clear data interpretation
  - **KPIs and Scorecards:** Key performance indicators to monitor and track hospital performance against targets

**Metrics Required**

1. Average & Median Waiting List
1. Current total Wait List

**Tools and Techniques**

- **Power BI:** Utilized for data visualization, reporting, and dashboard creation.
  - **Data Modeling:** Establishing relationships between different data tables for comprehensive analysis
  - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated columns, measures, and advanced data aggregations
  - **Power Query:** For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation
  - **Interactive Reports:** To enable dynamic exploration of patient wait list data
  - **Drill-Down Capabilities:** For in-depth analysis of specific metrics related to patient wait times and resource utilization.

**Conclusion**

This project delivers an effective and interactive Patient Wait List dashboard that provides critical insights into hospital operations. The dashboard will help hospital administrators and healthcare providers streamline patient flow, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the quality of care delivered to patients.
